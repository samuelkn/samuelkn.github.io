Here, I will share information and code from some projects I'm working on.

## Statistics

### Covariance structures in mixed models R

I work a lot with mixed linear models for different applications. As the implementation in R is often limited and varies a lot between the available packages, I started to built an overview of the syntax in the different packages, combined with some examples. Please see the the gitbook here: [Covariance structures in R](https://samuelkn.github.io/CovariancesInR/index.html)


## Other stuff

### Corona Dynamics

Out of personal interest, I conducted some analysis on the development of confirmed and death cases. See [here](https://samuelkn.github.io/Corona/cases.html). And the github repository with the R code [here](https://github.com/samuelkn/Corona).
