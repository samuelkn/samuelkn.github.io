### About me

I'm an agricultural scientist with a wide range of interests: While I focused on plant breeding during my study, I'm getting now more interested in a wider range of agronomic issues, like plant nutrition. I have a solid background in statistics (e.g. design and analysis of field experiements, meta-analysis, mixed models) and try to get more into other data science approaches (e.g. machine learning). Most of my analyses I conduct with R, trying to work exclusively on Linux and currently use [manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). I'm a very big fan of the wide variety of the documentation functions with markdown, like rmarkdown and jekyll (this page).
